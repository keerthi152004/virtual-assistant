This script demonstrates the implementation of a voice-activated assistant using Python, leveraging several key libraries such as `speech_recognition` for capturing and recognizing voice commands, `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech capabilities, `pywhatkit` for playing YouTube videos, `datetime` for fetching the current date and time, and `wikipedia` for retrieving information from Wikipedia. The assistant starts by initializing the speech recognizer and text-to-speech engine. The `talk` function is defined to convert text into spoken words using `pyttsx3`. The script then listens for voice commands through the microphone, processing them using Google's speech recognition service. If the keyword "john" is detected in the command, it is extracted and processed further.

The assistant is designed to execute specific actions based on the recognized commands. For example, it can play a song on YouTube by using `pywhatkit` to search and play the requested song, fetch and announce the current time or day using the `datetime` library, and search for information on Wikipedia, providing a brief summary of the topic. It handles exceptions gracefully, providing feedback if the speech recognition fails or if multiple or no results are found on Wikipedia. The script continuously listens for commands in a loop, allowing the user to interact with the assistant in real-time. If the command "stop" is detected, the assistant stops listening and ends the session. This voice-activated assistant demonstrates a practical application of Python in creating interactive, voice-controlled applications.
